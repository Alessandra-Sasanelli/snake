;; DATA TYPES

; a SnakeUnit is an Image
; It represents the little rectangles that the snake is made off

; The SnakeHead is an Image
; It represents the head of the snake
; it is an overlay of an eye, a tongue and a SnakeUnit

; an AppleUnit is an Image
; It represents the little rectangles that the apple is made off

; a Direction is one of these String
; - "up"
; - "left"
; - "down"
; - "right"

; a Game is one of:
; - #true : the game is running
; - #false : the game is lost and the application is on pause

; a Quit is one of:
; - #false : the game is on and is running
; - #true : the game is off and "close"

; a List<Posn> is one of:
;  - (cons Posn (cons Posn (cons Posn â€™())))
;  - (cons Posn List<Posn>)

; a Length is a Number as such:
; - the Number 3
; - Length + 1
; represents the length of the snake

; a Snake is a struct
; (make-snake position length direction)
; where:
; - position is a List<Posn>    --> represents the positions of the elements that make up the snake
; - length is a Length          --> the lenght of the snake
; - direction is a Direction    --> the direction of the head
(define-struct snake [position lenght direction])

; an Apple is a Position
; it represents the position of the apple at a particular moment

; an AppState is a Struct
; (make-appstate snake apple game quit)
; where:
; - snake is a Snake
; - apple is an Apple
; - game is a Game
; - quit is a Quit
